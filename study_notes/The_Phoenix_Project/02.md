# Chapter 2

Bill reaches for Dick Landry, the accounting head, to address the serious payroll issue that could violate labor laws
and trigger audit consequences. Data for hourly employees appears to have been zeroed out, as if they hadn't worked at
all this month. This is a new issue (at least to his recollection), first reported the previous day.

Payroll data flows from each division to a centralized systems incorporating specific tax tables and labor laws. The 
they manually verify that the aggregated totals match the detailed entries.

After evaluating the business risks, Bill heads to the IT building, noting the stark contrast in maintenance between 
the IT and finance buildings. He hears noise from help desk attendants and finds Wes (responsible for networking 
and distributed systems) and Patty (head of help desk services) in a conference room addressing a SAN outage. They 
shift their focus to the payroll issue, suspecting a connection.

Given the urgency, they best team members are being reassigned to focus on the issue, deprioritizing other tickets 
related to the Phoenix Project.

## Notes

- **Assessing Business Impact**: Bill's first action is to gauge the business impact and confirm if thereâ€™s a 
contingency plan in case they canâ€™t resolve the issue promptly.

- **Manual Overwrite API**: The author critiques the manual overwrite API as "error-prone and dangerous." However, it 
was implemented as a workaround to address frequent failures in the main process. While a high-quality development 
process aims to minimize bugs, no software can be entirely bug-free. For critical workflows like payroll, having 
manual overrides is beneficial in such cases. A good approach to balance risk here would be implementing thorough 
auditing and requiring dual approval for any manual intervention.

- **In-Person Meetings**: Bill physically visits various departments to engage with his colleaguesâ€”a practice that 
feels almost foreign post-COVID. Although this personal approach reflects the value of in-person interactions for 
urgent, cross-functional issues.
