# Chapter 31

Back at the company, the IT management team and Brent gather to identify their fundamental mistakes in the deployment
process and determine what changes are needed to achieve Erik’s goal of 10 deploys per day through. The development team
is the first to push back, arguing that their three-week sprints mean there will be nothing ready to deploy at such a
rapid pace. Patty, however, points out that small bug fixes, performance adjustments, and small business-aligned
changes—such as content updates happens daily and only deliver real value once deployed.

The teams remain skeptical, as the deployment process involves numerous steps across different areas. To address this,
they begin by listing all the steps involved and identifying where problems occurred during previous launches. Patty
then documents how long each step takes. Using this data, they pinpoint the two major bottlenecks: packaging and
ensuring environments are ready and synchronized.

Brent proposes a solution: the build scripts used to generate QA and production environments should also be used to
create development environments. This ensures that developers work in environments closely resembling production.
Additionally, these scripts must be checked into version control for consistency and reliability.

To tackle the second bottleneck, Brent and William decide to shift the responsibility of packaging to the development
team. They plan to refine Brent’s draft scripts into professional-grade tools, changing the artifact handled from dev to
IT from the raw source code to a packaged binary and configuration scripts.
