# Chapter 24

With recent organizational improvements, Bill enjoys a rare, peaceful Saturday with his family. However, his calm is
interrupted by a surprising late-night call from John, who had been absent since the audit meeting. John, drunk and at a
bar, prompts Bill to go see him. During their conversation, Bill confirms Erik's view that John's previous stance
contributed little to the company's value. Bill then ensures John gets home safely by putting him in a cab.

On Monday, John returns to work, expressing gratitude to Bill. He shares that he has set up a meeting with Dick Landry,
the CFO, indicating his intent to change his approach, collaborate more effectively, and finally add real value to the
team.
