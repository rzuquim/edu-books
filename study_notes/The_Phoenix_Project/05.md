# Chapter 5

Bill starts the day with yet another urgent meeting, this time about a preliminary internal SOX-404 audit. The auditors
present a staggering list of non-compliances, including sixteen significant deficiencies. Among the issues are critical
problems such as developers having direct access to production databases, the lack of a proper authorization process for
financial systems; but also simpler ones like outdated software with known vulnerabilities or small configuration
issues.

With only six working days until the external audit, it becomes clear that many of these issues cannot be resolved in
time. Updating outdated and unsupported systems poses significant risks of system failures, further complicating the
situation.

During the meeting, it’s revealed that the PII change responsible for the payroll issue is outside the SOX audit scope,
contradicting John’s earlier justification for bypassing the approval process.

Afterward, the team faces the challenge of allocating the same senior staff to both the audit preparations and the
Phoenix project, on top of their existing daily responsibilities. Bill decides to assess IT’s overall commitments to
justify hiring additional staff to Steve, the CEO. However, they lack a clear, centralized view of team commitments.
Patty takes on the task of creating a list of commitments for all IT staff, starting with those involved in audit and
Phoenix-related tasks. This will help Bill make the case for increasing the department’s capacity.

## Notes

- **Big picture management**: Managing tasks and commitments across departments in a large organization is obviously
  challenging. In a software-focused company, I think we must link issues and projects directly to code changes to
  achieve visibility and accountability. GitHub is mostly repository focused and tools like Jira are extremely
  bureaucratic and a pain to work with. But that is what we have today, so we must tag issues to achieve multi
  repository integration. There is also the challenge of easily linking an support ticket with the issue or the PR. Not
  even thinking about projects that will involve external vendors. Googling about this huge challenge I a tools that
  might worth investigating: [Backstage](https://backstage.io/).
