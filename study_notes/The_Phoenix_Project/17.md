# Chapter 17

Bill is finally enjoying some quality time with his son, feeling a temporary sense of relief without the weight of his
job responsibilities. He momentarily sets aside the anxiety of his precarious situation, juggling unemployment and a
double mortgage. After ignoring several calls from his colleagues, he eventually answers his phone and learns that his
predictions have come true: an attempt to fix the invoice outage has also taken down the inventory system. The team
feels betrayed by Bill's abrupt departure.

Back home, Bill lets three calls from Steve go to voicemail. His wife informs him that Steve even called her, asking her
to relay a message. Under pressure from his wife and their financial obligations, Bill finally returns Steveâ€™s call.
Steve apologizes for his previous behavior and offers Bill his job back, promising that they will work closely together
to help Steve understand the IT capabilities the company needs to succeed.
