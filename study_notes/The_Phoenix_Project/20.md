# Chapter 20

The project freeze is yielding positive results. With full attention on Phoenix, progress is noticeable, and disruptions
have been minimal, aside from a Sev 1 phone outage. The freeze highlights the benefits of single-tasking, such as
reduced context-switching and improved productivity.

However, the freeze comes with challenges. Managers are growing impatient with delays on other projects, and IT
leadership faces increasing pressure. To prevent a return to prioritizing work based on "who screams the loudest" after
the freeze, the team has one week to define a robust prioritization process.

Seeking guidance, Bill consults Erik, who takes him to the factory. Erik explains that every work center is governed by
four components (the 4 Ms): the machine, the man, the method, and the measures. Bill identifies parallels in IT, noting
that many work centers depend on Brent, the bottleneck, to function. To optimize throughput, Bill concludes that
projects not relying on Brent should be prioritized.

The next step is creating a process to predict whether a project will depend on the bottleneck. Erik emphasizes the
importance of investing in monitoring systems. By enhancing visibility, the team can:

    Identify bottleneck-dependent tasks.
    Spot idle resources or queued tasks waiting to be processed.
    Continuously refine prioritization and resource allocation.

The monitoring project becomes the priority, as it will enable a data-driven approach to improving IT workflows and
capacity planning.
