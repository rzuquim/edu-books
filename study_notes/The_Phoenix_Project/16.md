# Chapter 16

A new crisis emerges when Bill discovers that the invoice system has failed to generate invoices for the past three
days. To make matters worse, Dick, the CFO, cannot even retrieve the data to issue invoices manually. The team quickly
gathers to resolve the issue, ensuring no transactions are lost. Leadership emphasizes the need to proceed cautiously
and methodically, identifying the root cause before taking action.

At home, Bill reflects on the progress his team has made since the credit card data breach incident. They are now more
organized, conducting blameless post-mortems and incident rehearsals to prepare for future crises. Despite these
improvements, Bill receives a late-night call from Steve, who insists on an all-hands response to this emergency. Bill
warns that this approach will reinforce the dependency on Brent (the key bottleneck) and risks exacerbating the issue
through hasty decisions, similar to previous problems like the payroll outage.

Frustrated by upper management’s disregard for his advice and their continued undermining of his efforts, Bill reaches a
breaking point. He decides it’s time to resign.
