# Chapter 12

It's the Phoenix release date, and the QA and IT teams are scrambling to set up and validate the software in the test
environment. Meanwhile, development works to fix critical failures. The software runs on a developerâ€™s laptop but fails
in the deployment environment. Configuration proves challenging, with some crucial settings, such as firewall port
configurations, communicated too late.

The deployment is already three hours behind schedule, and the testing cycle itself takes another three hours to
complete. Meanwhile, development continues delivering patches as single files rather than full packages, leading to
version control chaos. This disrupts QA's ability to ensure that releases are regression-free.

Facing a hard deadline of 8 a.m., when the points of sale (POS) open, the team assesses that they have only a few hours
before the "point of no return" (the database schema migration). Once started, it locks them into the deployment.
Recognizing the risks, Bill writes an email and calls Steve to recommend postponing the release. However, Steve
delegates the decision to Sarah, who insists the delay is IT's fault and refuses to budge.

Back on IT, the challenges intensify. The database migration is taking way too long and won't be done time to stores
open. The team is forced to prioritize understanding how the POS will function with partially migrated data.

They also find significant memory leaks that will require regular manual intervention to restart processes. Since they
also are using physical servers (due to performance requirements), they are manually setting up new servers to
accommodate the foreseeable load.

In the morning the Phoenix was up and running but all of the POS are down leading to manual financial operations on the
store and a lot of complaint calls.

By morning, Phoenix is running, but all POS systems are down. The sales team starts to write instructions to the stores
crew on how to operate manually. Manual operations triggers a deluge of complaint calls. Meanwhile, critical bugs plague
the site, with the most damning discovery being that it leaks credit card data.

## Notes

- **Environment Configuration**: as a developer I assume it is rare to document the correct ports and configurations. A
  sane approach to me would be setup a script that starts the program in a test environment sniffing the required ports
  and points, and configuring the network gradually until we can achieve some healthy state. Them the program would emit
  a document listing what was needed so we can apply it when releasing to production. I don't known if there is an off
  the shelf product capable of doing such process.

- **What kind of project is this?**: I really cannot grasp the scale of the Phoenix project and how can it deliver value
  to the company. It just look like a big rewrite with no benefits at all.
