# Chapter 11

Later that day, Patty calls Bill, expressing skepticism about the effectiveness of the change management process they
championed. Most scheduled changes are not being implemented at all. Various reasons account for this, but a recurring
issue is the heavy reliance on Brent to execute these changes. Similar to incident fixes, the team must address the
dependency on this key resource to improve the process.

Despite the apparent ineffectiveness, Bill decides not to abandon the process. Instead, he points out that the
visibility they now have into incomplete changes exists solely because of the process they implemented. To address the
dependency on Brent, they agree to specifically identify and flag changes that require his involvement on the change
cards. This adjustment aims to emphasize the bottleneck and create actionable data to reduce reliance on Brent.

## Notes

- **Iterative process improvement**: Itâ€™s commendable that they don't give up on the process at the first sign of
  failure. Instead, they refine it iteratively, leveraging real data to identify pain points and implement targeted
  solutions. This approach mirrors agile principles, emphasizing adaptation and responsiveness over rigid adherence to
  an initial plan.
