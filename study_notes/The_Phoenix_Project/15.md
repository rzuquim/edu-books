# Chapter 15

During breakfast with his wife, Bill reflects on the highs and lows of his promotion. Despite the recent project
failures, he feels a sense of accomplishment. On his way to work, he receives an email that bolsters his optimism: the
change management process successfully prevented a production issue.

With Phoenix now stabilized, there’s a backlog of changes that had been postponed. Bill finally identifies the fourth
type of work Erik mentioned: unplanned work. These unplanned tasks, which were necessary to keep the company afloat
during the Phoenix crisis, hindered progress on all other types of work.

Bill realizes that most managerial efforts aim to reduce or prevent unplanned work. Energized by this insight, he calls
Erik to confirm his understanding. Erik commends Bill's discovery and advises him to focus on _The Second Way_, or
eliminating unplanned work. Erik references The Goal by Eli Goldratt and outlines the five key steps for managing
constraints (exposing only three of them):

    Identify the constraint: Pinpoint the most critical bottleneck in the workflow.
    Exploit the constraint: Ensure the constraint is focused on essential tasks.
    Subordinate the constraint: Align the entire workflow’s pace to the constraint.

# Notes

- **Issue prevention detection**: preventive and defensive efforts often go unnoticed and underappreciated. Highlighting
  incidents that were avoided could help justify processes and policies. Recognizing these efforts can also boost morale
  and emphasize the importance of proactive work.
