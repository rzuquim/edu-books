# Chapter 25

In the meeting with Dick, the CFO, John seeks to understand Dick's exact role within the company. They discover that
Dick also oversees operations and is primarily motivated by the financial success of the business. When asked about his
goals, Dick presents two slides: one detailing financial objectives and another posing questions about the company's
long-term sustainability.

When asked how the IT department can help achieve these goals, Dick's response is to deliver Phoenix. However, Bill
realizes that most, if not all, of the goals on the slide rely on IT, indicating that Dick has a limited understanding
of IT's broader role in the company.

Bill consults Erik to figure out how to align IT's efforts with top management's goals and ensure IT is not undervalued.
Erik advises that the key is to find the right scope for IT within the business. This means avoiding under-scoping,
where IT's efforts could jeopardize business goals, and over-scoping, where unnecessary IT work is done.

Erik uses a metaphor to illustrate the importance of preventive IT work: to ensure timely delivery of goods, the company
uses a fleet of trucks. If a truck breaks down due to missed oil changes, the delivery goal is at risk. To prevent this,
the company could implement a KPI tracking the percentage of trucks with recent oil changes. Similarly, IT must track
maintenance tasks, like vendor patches, to prevent breakdowns in IT services.
