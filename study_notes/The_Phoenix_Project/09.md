# Chapter 9

Bill is pulled away from an important budget meeting to address a Sev 1 incident that has brought operations to a halt.
He rushes to the war room, where his teammates are struggling to identify the root cause of the issue. As usual, Brent
(the team's indispensable but over-relied-upon resource) manages to solve the problem. However, Brent provides no clear
explanation of what he did or why the issue occurred, leaving the rest of the team in the dark.

Frustrated, Bill confronts Patty for not having a clear record of the changes made the previous day, which could have
helped pinpoint potential causes of the incident. He also reprimands Wes for allowing Brent to operate independently
without collaboration, emphasizing the risks of introducing further instability and the missed opportunity for the team
to learn from the situation.

Determined to instill better practices, Bill mandates that the team hold bi-weekly incident call simulations. These
practice runs aim to prepare the team for future crises by improving structure, communication, and access to critical
resources during incidents.

Later in the day, the team holds a full change management meeting. They have a productive discussion, prioritizing
changes for the upcoming week and agreeing to deprioritize any changes on Friday, the day the Phoenix project is
scheduled to ship.

At the end of the day, Bill reflects on the "four types of work" and identifies the third type:

1. Business projects
2. Internal IT projects
3. Changes scheduling and application
