# Chapter 23

Despite focusing entirely on the Phoenix project, Brent misses the due date for what he initially estimated as a simple
task. The delay escalates significantly, drawing complaints from the business side. The root cause is that this
seemingly simple task involves multiple steps requiring execution and approval from different personnel. With most of
the IT department occupied, each hand-off results in substantial delays, as tasks wait for available resources.

The IT management team recognizes that all resources require some idle time to prevent work-in-progress (WIP) from
getting stuck in queues. This slack time is essential to maintaining flow and reducing bottlenecks.

They also identify the need for a dedicated role responsible for managing waiting queues and the hand-offs between
different workstations. This role would oversee task transitions, ensuring smoother workflow and minimizing delays.
