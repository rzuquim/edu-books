# Chapter 7

The last morning of Bill's first week as VP begins with yet another disruption, but this time it’s an unusual one: he’s
invited to meet Erik Reid, a potential board member evaluating the company's IT capabilities. Despite the chaos of
ongoing priorities, Bill obliges and meets Erik over doughnuts.

Erik quickly challenges Bill's understanding of work, implying that Bill lacks a fundamental grasp of the concept. To
illustrate his point, Erik takes Bill to visit a plant facility, guiding him to observe the workflow across various
production stations. He highlights that optimizing a single step of a process is futile if that step is not the
bottleneck of the entire workflow. This simple yet powerful insight sparks a discussion on how principles of Production
Engineering (often dismissed as irrelevant to IT) are highly applicable to knowledge work.

Erik introduces the Three Ways, a foundational framework for IT operations and development:

    The First Way: Create a fast and smooth flow of work from development to operations.
    The Second Way: Shorten feedback loops to identify and fix quality issues, preventing rework.
    The Third Way: Foster a culture of experimentation and learning from failures to achieve mastery.

Finally he proposes a challenge to identity the **four types of work**, the first one being **business project work**.

## Notes

- **Is this bullshit?**: This abstract view of the workflow sounds vague and useless. I think it would be better to state
  the concepts with example and actionable practices in real scenarios.

## New Vocabulary

`wryly`
