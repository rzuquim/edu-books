# Chapter 6

Patty delivers the promised resource allocation report, which confirms the IT team is severely understaffed, with nearly
one project per team member. The distribution is uneven, with most resources focused on the Phoenix project, leaving
smaller projects to suffer significant delays. Alarmingly, even if the entire IT department worked exclusively on the
Phoenix project and SOX audit, everything else would be stalled for a full year.

The report highlights that break-fixes (addressing ongoing system issues) are the third most time-consuming activity.
Reducing this workload emerges as a critical strategy to free up resources for higher-priority projects. Calculations
suggest that hiring seven additional staff is necessary to stabilize the situation, though onboarding and training would
take about a year before improvements are fully realized.

Later, Bill attends the newly mandatory CAB meeting, where frustrations about the current change process and its
associated software surface. In response, Bill proposes a simple, low-tech solution: pen and paper. Each team member
writes down the changes they wish to implement in the coming week on paper cards.

This practical and immediate approach resonates with the team, resulting in an enthusiastic submission of many change
cards (perhaps too many to process in one week). Despite this, Bill encourages the team to keep submitting cards,
emphasizing the importance of maintaining their engagement.

## Notes

- **Process validation**: The decision to use pen and paper highlights an important principle: Start simple to validate
  processes before scaling up. While this approach is labor-intensive (requiring manual digitization later),  
  it allows for quick feedback loops, making it easier to identify pain points and iterate. This ensures the process is
  not only functional but also embraced by the team.

- **Meeting facilitation**: The CAB meeting drifted into a philosophical debate about "What is a change?", a common
  pitfall in collaborative discussions. While such debates can be meaningful, they derail the meeting's purpose. On such
  meetings a mediator can redirect off-topic discussions or schedule them for later, ensuring the team stays focused on
  actionable outcomes.
