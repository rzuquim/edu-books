# Chapter 29

Following the second Phoenix deployment, the IT team meets with Steve to address Sarah's unauthorized changes. Sarah
defends her actions, arguing that agility is necessary to outpace the competition. However, Bill counters by
highlighting the damage caused by rogue projects to data integrity, which is essential for understanding customer
needs—one of the CFO's pillars for success.

The team then discusses aligning expectations for the Phoenix project’s outcomes. Erik suggests that, now that they can
control the flow of work, they should focus on reducing the batch size of work to create a faster feedback loop. This
means shipping smaller, incremental changes more frequently. Bill's initial idea to halt deployments until QA
environments match production would hinder their progress. Given Phoenix's complexity, they decide to roll out smaller
features outside of Phoenix to help meet revenue goals more quickly.

The team chooses to concentrate on features like personalized recommendations based on historical purchases and
demographic data.

## Notes

- **Discussion in Business Terms**: On the discussion, Bill focuses on the business damage caused by Sarah’s changes,
  tailoring his arguments to address the CEO’s concerns and proposing collaborative solutions.

- **Acceptance of Constraints**: In the final discussion, Bill acknowledges the need to demonstrate revenue growth to
  shareholders while recognizing the limitations of the development team. He accepts these realities before suggesting
  actionable next steps, a different attitude from the beginning of the book.
