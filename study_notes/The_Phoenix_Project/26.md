# Chapter 26

Following Erik's guidance, the IT team begins studying and understanding the business by interviewing key stakeholders.
They start with the VP of Manufacturing Sales, who oversees the "sales pipeline" and "sales forecast accuracy." The
objective is to uncover how IT can support these areas.

The VP explains that the "sales forecast accuracy" begins with a revenue target set by the CFO and the board. However,
the sales team finds the target unrealistic, leading to demoralization and the departure of top performers. He also
highlights the issue of losing sales due to stockouts, while items with lower demand are overstocked.

Bill realizes that accurate knowledge of store inventory would directly benefit sales by aligning stock levels with
customer demand. He underscores the need to understand how stock data is currently generated.

Another challenge is the extraction of CRM reports, a system essential for the daily operations of the sales force. A
recent critical issue was the phone system outage, especially because it happened on a key period: the end of the
quarter. This problem, caused by a unauthorized vendor change, underscores the need for better vendor monitoring,
leading to a united call for more IT resources.

The team then meets Maggie, who sponsors the Phoenix project. She defines success by whether customers recommend the
company to friends. Unfortunately, this metric is difficult to track due to inaccurate data in the order and inventory
management systems. Consequently, Maggie relies on interviews with store managers and customer focus groups. Her primary
need from IT is accurate online reporting.

These interviews help the IT team link their services directly to the company's success metrics, laying the groundwork
for better alignment and support.
