# Chapter 4

Bill begins the day already overwhelmed, diving into emails and voice mails early in the morning despite the grueling
previous day. Among the flood of messages, one stands out: an urgent email from Sarah Moulton, the VP of Retail
Operations, regarding the Phoenix Project's release date. Her tone implies frustration, suggesting that IT is the
bottleneck delaying the project, and Bill is summoned to explain the holdup.

Bill expects the previous day's major incident would be sufficient justification for the delays in providing the Phoenix
test environment. However, during the meeting, Sarah (supported by Steve, the CEO) reinforces the notion that IT is the
root cause of the delay. The company cannot afford to miss the deadline, as it has already been committed to investors
and market analysts.

Despite Billâ€™s warnings about the risks of launching without adequate testing and validation, the decision is made to
proceed. The Phoenix Project is already over budget and delayed too many times, leaving Bill with no choice but to
allocate all available resources to deliver the test environment and attempt to minimize the potential disaster of an
untested launch.

Later, Bill attends a Change Advisory Board (CAB) meeting only to find it empty. Patty, who oversees change management,
explains that no one attends these meetings because each department has its own change processes, partly due to the
overly bureaucratic nature of the change control process. Recognizing this as a critical issue (one that contributed to
the payroll outage) Bill decides to take action. He sends an email declaring that attendance at the next CAB meeting
will be mandatory, aiming to regain visibility and control over changes across the organization.

## Notes

- **Environment specs**: IT could not deliver the desired test environment partially because the developers
  specifications were not precise enough. I am becoming more and more attracted to technical communication happening
  always with "code" (programming languages or markup). This way we can ensure precision and derive diagrams and other
  more intelligible docs if needed. This specific issue could be resolved with something like a `docker-compose.yml` or
  `terraform`. In my mind there is no excuse for a developer to not learn such tools, submitting the specification this
  way would lead to a informed discussion on the code-review process that would document and train the team on this
  tech.

- **Help-desk issues**: the chapter portraits some "simple" help-desk issues like sharing read access to a calendar,
  laptop malfunctioning due to security updates, old and slow hardware. No idea how to fix this one, but it seems to me
  that part of the problem comes from the corporative mentality that big vendors like Microsoft, Amazon or Oracle
  provides safer choices. I think this is fallacious, in reality they come with its own set of issues and hidden costs.
  But I am no expert in this area.

- **Best practices**: ITIL practices (and software quality assurance processes) are interesting to give maturity to the
  development process. Unfortunately the cost of applying such activities on day to day work has a huge impact on
  productivity. Here too I think automation is the only sane way, and we must provide a path to skip the process when
  needed. Always tracking what was skipped, judging and adjusting the process based on this metric.

- **Prioritization**: on e-mails, support tickets and changes everything on the company is classified as urgent. In this
  scenario no real prioritization is possible. That are methodologies to for prioritization like RICE, WSJF or a Change
  Priority Matrix. But I make not really sure how objective these methods really are.
