# Chapter 32

The customer recommendations project, now called the Unicorn Project, kicks off as a greenfield initiative with close
collaboration between developers and IT. To bypass the bureaucracy of directly accessing the Phoenix database, they
decide to replicate its data (along with inventory management system data) into an open-source database.

Meanwhile, the team sets up build scripts to automate the creation of development, QA, and production environments. They
also streamline onboarding by virtualising development dependencies. With a smooth workflow, developers start exceeding
their feature goals and decide to shorten sprint intervals to two weeks for faster iteration.

Amid the project's momentum, Bill discovers that the CFO and Sarah are exploring the possibility of splitting the
company. They have secretly enlisted Brent to assess IT risks related to the split. Realizing he is caught in a
political battle, Bill turns to Steve for help in keeping Brent focused on the Unicorn Project.

## Notes

- Greenfield projects often feel highly productive because they start with a clean slateâ€”no technical debt, no legacy
  constraints, and a small, highly aligned team. But as they grow, complexity creeps in: dependencies increase,
  coordination becomes harder, and maintaining velocity requires deliberate effort.
