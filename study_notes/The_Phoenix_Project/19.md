# Chapter 19

To foster trust, Steve asks the management team to share personal stories that shaped their professional journeys. These
moments of vulnerability help establish a foundation for collaboration and mutual understanding.

Shifting focus to work challenges, Steve highlights a recurring issue: IT commitments are often perceived as unreliable.
Despite meeting development deadlines, low-quality software disrupts operations, causing delays in deploying fixes and
features. This creates a vicious cycle where accumulating technical debt results in unplanned work and emergencies.

Bill revisits Erik's plant analogy, explaining how factories assess the risk of accepting new orders based on their
impact on ongoing work. Similarly, IT projects often incur technical debt to meet deadlines, but unchecked debt leads to
escalating unplanned work. Bill notes that the inability to prioritize or defer work exacerbates the problem, especially
when every task is treated as urgent.

Bill proposes halting all IT efforts outside Phoenix for two weeks to focus on reducing WIP. Erik supports this,
explaining that reducing WIP will improve delivery speed and quality. John objects, citing mandatory audit concerns, but
Erik counters, warning that failing to address the company's operational inefficiencies could lead to bankruptcy, making
audit compliance irrelevant.
