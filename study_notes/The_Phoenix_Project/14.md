# Chapter 14

By Monday night operations are back to normal on the stores. As required the leadership waits to be inquired by Steve
one by one. When it comes to Bill's turn they discovered that the CEO blames IT for the whole fiasco and is pretending
to outsource the entire IT department.

After the dire news Chris (from development) invites Bill for lunch and they chat about the common challenges they are
facing on their respective areas. They decided to fight to keep IT alive in company on the 90 days they have to prove
their worth.

Chris genuinely invites the ops guy to celebrate the end of the herculean effort of the last work week, but for ops the
job was not over. They are still having to handle transaction issues generated by the very code they are celebrating.
But to fix things on the company Bill sees as very important that both teams can mingle, so he insists they take half
hour to join the party.
