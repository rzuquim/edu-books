# Chapter 34

The marketing campaign led by the Unicorn Project is a massive success, driving unprecedented traffic to the e-commerce
platform. Despite the initial strain, the IT team works tirelessly, and by the afternoon, the online shopping experience
becomes tolerable for customers.

However, another major issue arises the next morning, on Black Friday. Demand far exceeds expectations, and customers
looking for products promoted by the Unicorn campaign leave empty-handed because they are out of stock. The team quickly
meets to devise a plan to sustain sales throughout the weekend.

By Monday, Steve congratulates the team for achieving record-breaking sales. During the meeting, Sarah proposes a new
challenge: matching a competitorâ€™s feature that allows customers to order custom-built kits. However, Wes sees a
roadblock. The company's inventory system is an outdated mainframe application that was outsourced years ago. The only
way to implement the new feature would be to break the contract with the vendor, pay a hefty termination fee, and
reintegrate the vendor's team into the company.

Despite the high costs and risks, Steve, impressed by the Unicorn Project's success, decides to move forward with the
plan.
