# Chapter 3

The team consults Brent, whoâ€™s already focused on the SAN issue. The crash stemmed from a long-overdue firmware update.
The vendorâ€™s upgrade path failed and it might have led to the data corruption during a rollback attempt.

They discover that only one database field is corrupted, indicating that the SAN failure wasn't widespread. They also
learn that a developer recently asked around about the timesheet database schema to apply a security patch before going
on vacation.

The team then reach out for **John**, the security lead, and learns that a PII tokenization product was deployed due to
an upcoming audit, intended to prevent personal data storage in databases. John pushed for the fast-tracked deployment
since the next available window was four months out, and the audit was within a week.

Ultimately, the team couldn't resolve the issue in time, forcing them to execute Plan B. Bill ends his first day as VP
frustrated, arriving home after midnight.

## Notes

- **Big-Bang Update**: avoid large disruptive changes. On this case it happened due to lack of smaller maintenance
  windows. Frequent, smaller updates generally minimize risks of major crashes, though exceptions exist (like the recent
  CrowdStrike incident).

- **Centralized Dependencies**: Relying on a single SAN for multiple critical systems created a single point of failure,
  likely for cost-saving. This kind of centralization not only impacts dependent subsystems during outages but also
  complicates scheduling maintenance due to conflicting usage patterns.

- **Security Patch Urgency**: Security patches are prioritized, sometimes with insufficient impact assessment on other
  areas. Here, an update happened dangerously close to payroll processing, a key business event.

- **Blame Culture**: Upon identifying the probable cause of the issue, the immediate reaction is punitive, reflecting a
  blame-oriented culture.

- **Lack of Test/Staging Environments**: Reproducing complex systems in staging can be challenging, underscoring the
  need for solution partitioning and phased rollouts, like canary deployments, in production.

- **Change Processes**: Effective processes need automated enforcement. When bypassed, exceptions should be documented
  and shared transparently.
