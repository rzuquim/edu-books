# Chapter 30

Once again, Bill seeks Erikâ€™s advice at the manufacturing plant. Erik introduces the concept of takt time, which is the
cycle time required to meet customer demand. He explains how the engineering team, after weeks of observation and
experimentation, developed a single machine that eliminated the production bottleneck for their most in-demand product.
This breakthrough allowed them to stop producing large batches, which often created work-in-progress (WIP) at the next
stage. As a result, overall throughput increased, batch sizes were reduced, and potential defects no longer risked
scrapping entire batches.

Erik challenges Bill to apply the same principles to the Phoenix project. He sets a bold target of 10 deploys per day
for Phoenix. To achieve this, Bill will need to foster a DevOps culture and automate most of the manual deployment steps
currently in place by building a deployment pipeline. The goal is to increase the rate of experimentation. Since new
features are essentially gambles, the faster they can be deployed, the quicker their impact on business value can be
measured.
