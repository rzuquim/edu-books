# Chapter 8

Bill spends his weekend preparing a detailed presentation to justify hiring more resources for IT, only to have his
request summarily denied during a brief meeting with Steve, the CEO. Steve reprimands him for complaining about the
conflicting demands on IT resources, insisting that both the SOX audit compliance and the Phoenix project must be
completed on time, without exceptions. Bill is left frustrated and disillusioned, realizing that he will receive no
additional help despite the overwhelming workload.

Following this disheartening meeting, Bill attends the CAB (Change Advisory Board) meeting, which has amassed an
overwhelming pile of proposed changes. Recognizing that it's impossible for the small team to handle the review process
manually, Bill and Patty decide to classify changes into two categories:

- High-risk changes: These require CAB approval.
- Low-risk changes: These bypass the CAB but require managerial approval, shifting accountability to the respective
  managers.

Additionally, they agree to actively monitor the success rates of both high-risk and low-risk changes to evaluate the
effectiveness of this approach. Patty raises concerns about the sustainability of the manual process, and Bill
acknowledges the need to revisit and automate it in the future.
