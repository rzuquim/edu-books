# Chapter 21

The external audit meeting takes place. Despite the many IT security flaws, it is a success. The financial team
convinces auditors that even without strict IT controls, any malicious tampering would be caught downstream by expert
reviews and daily/weekly inventory reconciliation reports. This human safety net reassures the auditors and highlights
the importance of combining system processes with manual oversight.

After the meeting, John vents his frustration about being the only one advocating for compliance and security in the
organization. Erik interrupts, pointing out John's "scope error": focusing on idealistic security measures instead of
addressing the company's immediate need for survival. Erik critiques John's adherence to illusory standards, emphasizing
the necessity of aligning security efforts with the company's current realities and priorities.

## Notes

- **Human approval processes**: Incorporating manual reconciliation and expert reviews complements automated controls,
  providing a crucial layer of fraud detection and error correction.

- **Security auditing in real life**: Security efforts should align with organizational priorities, particularly during
  critical times. Overemphasis on perfection or rigid standards can obstruct progress and misallocate resources. Audits
  help validate processes but are often more about political assurance than practical value. This highlights the need to
  balance compliance requirements with innovation and operational flexibility. More often these audits limit the
  creativity of the team, forcing us the adopt the same tools and frameworks that will be easily validated be auditors.
