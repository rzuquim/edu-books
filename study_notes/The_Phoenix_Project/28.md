# Chapter 28

Bill begins drafting an email to Steve, highlighting the significant improvements his team has achieved. His functional
laptop serves as a tangible example, but the statistical data also supports the progress: Sev 1 outages have
dramatically decreased, and incident recovery times are now much faster.

Reflecting on their journey, Bill realizes that a well-organized team fosters trust and transparency, and regular
practices of mock outages led to good habits and mastery. Also reducing unnecessary tasks such as redundant audit
processes and maintaining the cafeteria's POS systems helped them to focus on activities that generate actual value to
the business.

In a surprising discovery, John’s team, while conducting routine cost management queries, uncovers that Sarah has
violated the project freeze. She signed a large contract with a vendor to conduct customer data mining and integrate
these analytics into the POS system—projects that breach the company's data privacy policy and some state regulations.

This presents Bill with a political challenge. Steve holds Sarah in high regard for her creative strategies and has
historically overlooked her flaws, even grooming her as a potential future CEO.

On Friday, despite scheduling minor changes for Phoenix, it takes three hours to deploy the new version to QA and pass
all tests, a significant relative improvement, but still way behind schedule. However, during the production rollout, a
database migration step fails, leaving them unable to roll back.

Unlike previous incidents, the team is well-prepared for all scenarios, including the worst-case of operating sales
manually without the POS system. They trace the issue to an unapproved change from one of Sarah's projects, implemented
through Brent, which the migration script could not handle. The team resolves to establish measures to ensure QA
environments exactly match production to prevent such discrepancies.

Ultimately, they manage to deliver the new version before the stores open on Saturday.

## Notes

- **Operational Metrics**: While Bill can personally feel the improvements, they can only quantitatively report success
  because they measured key metrics like outage count and recovery time before and after implementing changes.
