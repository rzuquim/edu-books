# Chapter 18

After accepting Steve's offer to return, Bill attends his first meeting post-resignation. The mood is tense, as most of
his teammates feel betrayed by his abrupt departure. Acknowledging the tension, Steve starts the meeting by thanking the
IT team for their tireless efforts to address the Phoenix issues and takes responsibility for the challenges they faced.
Steve also admits his mistakes in dismissing Billâ€™s earlier warnings and recognizes IT as a critical department for the
companyâ€™s success.

To rebuild trust between business and IT, Bill shares his personal story, aiming to foster a more empathetic and
collaborative relationship.
