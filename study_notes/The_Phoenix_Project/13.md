# Chapter 13

The Phoenix release is a public fiasco, and the team is focusing on restoring regular operations. During a meeting,
Sarah proposes prioritizing usability fixes for Phoenix after addressing the POS issues. However, the team disagrees,
arguing that performance problems should take precedence before tackling anything else.

After the meeting, Bill observes the finance team manually but efficiently handling the chaos caused by Phoenix through
manual processes. But during this trip, another critical issue emerges: the very data that stores are transmitting to
the finance team to analyse contains customer credit card data, constituting a severe data breach. This compounds the
earlier credit card breach from the Phoenix site, exposing even more customers. Given that fines are levied per
cardholder, immediate destruction of this data is necessary. The situation worsens with auditors being on-site the same
day.

Once this crisis is under control, John reminds Bill that the SOX-404 internal audit response letter is due that day.
Most of IT is tied up dealing with Phoenix, but John allocates two engineers to assist with remediation estimates.
Amidst the chaos, Bill reflects on how these crises are unifying the company and highlighting IT's critical role in
business operations.
