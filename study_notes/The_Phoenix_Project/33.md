# Chapter 33

Sarah emails the chairman, questioning why Bill is undermining the project to explore a potential company split.
Recognizing the political complexity, Bill turns to Steve for guidance.

Meanwhile, on the Unicorn Project, despite producing correct results, the software is running significantly slower than
expected. Since to be impossible to provision the raw computational power to make the project feasible, the most
cost-effective solution is to offload computation to a cloud provider, paying only for the compute time used. However, a
security specialist from Johnâ€™s team raises concerns about sending customer data to an external provider. He is tasked
with preparing a list of countermeasures and controls to mitigate these risks.

A week later, they assess the impact of using cloud computing and determine it to be a major success. Encouraged by the
results, they begin planning to migrate even more environments to the cloud. Business-wise, the project is also
delivering promising outcomes. After running a small-scale test campaign with 1% of the customer base, they achieve an
outstanding conversion rate. The next challenge is preparing IT to handle a potential surge in traffic if the full
launch during Thanksgiving is successful.

The team also celebrates a major cultural shift: deployments have become routine rather than high-stakes,
once-per-quarter events. Thanks to automation, even security checks are now integrated early in the pipeline, running on
every developer commit. The highlight of these improvements comes when they discover a critical bug, fix it, and deploy
the update within an hour, something that would have been unthinkable in the past.
