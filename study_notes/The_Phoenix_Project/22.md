# Chapter 22

Following the audit meeting, Bill prioritizes the monitoring project to track dependencies on Brent, aiming to better
prioritize work and improve the delivery rate. The team discusses the parallels between a factory assembly line and IT
workflows, agreeing to test their theories in a controlled setting: the help desk for laptop and desktop provisioning.

**Key Steps Taken**

- Kanban Implementation:

> Patty organizes basic service workflows on a Kanban board, enabling visualization of tasks and tracking of lead times.
> Within a week, this approach reduces delivery times and increases throughput.

- Workflow Documentation:

> Patty documents frequent service requests, resources required, and the time taken to complete each task. This leads to
> a precise schedule for laptop replacements, ensuring predictable delivery dates.

- Continuous Improvement (Improvement Kata):

> A process is introduced to iteratively reduce errors in setting up new laptops, ensuring better quality and efficiency
> over time.

- Change Categorization and Prioritization:

> Changes on the change board are color-coded to facilitate prioritization once the freeze ends. The team begins ranking
> tasks, prioritizing work that reduces or avoids reliance on Brent.

- Protecting the Constraint:

> Following Erik's advice, Bill focuses on isolating Brent, ensuring that only projects that either lessen Brent's
> involvement or bypass him entirely are prioritized. This strategy protects the bottleneck while enabling smoother
> workflows.

## New Vocabulary

`glum`

> Moody and melancholy; dejected.
