# Chapter 10

The Phoenix team holds a daily stand-up meeting where QA reports that they are still finding bugs at twice the rate of
fixes being completed. Kirsten, acting as the Product Owner for the project, grows frustrated and repeatedly asks for
Brent, blaming IT for being the bottleneck. Bill steps in and assures the team that he will address the bottleneck by
offloading some of Brent's responsibilities.

Bill visits Brent's cubicle to observe him and understand how to keep him focused on Phoenix. He discovers that Brent is
overwhelmed by constant direct requests from employees across the company, bypassing formal processes. These
interruptions are significantly detracting from his work on Phoenix. To help, Bill authorizes him to ignore non-Phoenix
issues and even suggests faking a vacation to avoid being pulled into minor problems.

Later, Bill discusses with management how to address the systemic over-reliance on Brent. They recognize that Brent
refusal or is incapacity to document his work or explain his fixes during post-mortems exacerbates the issue. The team
devises a plan to establish a pool of senior engineers who will be responsible for handling incidents. If escalation to
Brent becomes necessary, the assigned engineer will observe and document how Brent resolves the issue. Moreover, the
same type of incident cannot be escalated twice.

To encourage knowledge sharing, Brent will not be allowed to directly fix escalated issues. Instead, he must guide the
assigned engineer through the resolution process, ensuring knowledge transfer without relying on Brentâ€™s hands-on
intervention.

## Notes

- **Process-based solution limitations**: The proposed process addresses the symptoms but not the root cause of Brent's
  isolationist behavior. His poor communication and reluctance to document work are personality-driven challenges that
  may require additional support or coaching.

- **Leveraging tools for knowledge sharing**: While the pair-programming style approach might be effective, it could
  also frustrate Brent and hinder collaboration. Alternatives like mandatory screen recording, terminal logging, or
  session replay tools could complement the process, allowing senior engineers to review Brent's methods in detail
  without requiring his constant engagement. Interestingly, Patty suggests a similar solution, indicating alignment with
  this idea.
