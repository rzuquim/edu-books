# Chapter 35

Life has quieted down after all the managerial changes IT implemented. The team has matured to the point where they are
running chaos tests on infrastructure and security directly in production environments.

Bill heads to a party celebrating the Unicorn Project’s success but is invited to arrive early for a private
conversation with Steve. During their talk, Steve reveals that Bill is the unanimous choice to become the new CIO.
However, Steve has even bigger plans. He wants to groom Bill to become the company’s next COO. He believes that as IT
becomes increasingly integral to business operations, future COOs must have deep IT expertise.

After their conversation, the rest of the team arrives, and they all celebrate their hard-earned success together.
